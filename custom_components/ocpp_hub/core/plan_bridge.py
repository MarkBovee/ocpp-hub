"""The bridge between the planning of the Raedian app and the plan of the hub: recognise what the app asks, answer it.

The app keeps no planning of its own: it reads the charger's. The hub sits in between, so it can answer for the charger
from the plan it holds (and take over what the app writes), instead of passing the app's planning on to the charger.

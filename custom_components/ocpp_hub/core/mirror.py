"""The vendor mirror: a read-only copy of what the chargers say, sent on to the vendor's own backend.

The mirror listens to the sessions of the central system. For every connected charger it keeps a link to the vendor
backend where the charger shows up as a virtual charge point. The vendor can look but not touch: its commands are
answered by the mirror and never reach the charger.

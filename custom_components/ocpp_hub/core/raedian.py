"""The binary planning protocol of the Raedian app, carried in DataTransfer (READIAN / RemoteConfiguration).

It was worked out from captured exchanges, not from documentation, so only what was seen is decoded:

    frame   = head, command, 00 00, length (2 bytes, little endian), 08, check, session (8 bytes), payload
    check   = the XOR of every other byte of the frame
    head    = FE from the cloud, AA from the charger
    command A7 = the planning. Written with payload 01, count, then count windows of 12 bytes:
        01, overnight flag, weekday mask (bit 0 = Monday ... bit 6 = Sunday), start (4 bytes, seconds after
        midnight), end (same), 20.
        Read with payload 00; an empty plan answers 00 00. A write is acknowledged with the single byte 00.

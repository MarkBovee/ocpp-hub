Rules checked for ``strings.json`` and every ``translations/*.json``:

- the file is valid JSON;
- no string contains HTML-like text such as ``<port>``;
- an entry under ``issues`` has a ``title`` and either a ``description`` (not fixable) or a ``fix_flow`` (fixable),
  never both (hassfest: "two or more values in the same group of exclusion 'fixable'").
